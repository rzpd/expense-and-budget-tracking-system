# expense-and-budget-tracking-system
This project is about expense and budget tracking using Python as its main language and SQLite as its database. Currently, it has no GUI which makes it less interesting, but I plan to add it in the future with frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt. Please note that the feature for this project is still limited to general feature. I will consider adding some features in the future, such as giving a warning email to the user in case current monthly spending is already near or passing its monthly limit or reporting their monthly expenses on the last day of the month.
